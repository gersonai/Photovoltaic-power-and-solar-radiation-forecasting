```
1- Put de dataset in the same folder as "pv_forcasting_2_3classes_onColab.ipynb" and "Sunsets.py"
2- Name your 3 classes data "trainval_phys_3calsses" and "trest_phys_3calsses" or change
the files name in the notebook and make sure they are also in the dataset folder.
```

Note: Below my best hyper-parameters for the 3 class predictor training:
```
batch_size = 256
optimizer = Adam
lr = 3e-6
nb epochs = 10
```
