> 1- Put de dataset in the same folder as "pv_forcasting_2_3classes_onColab.ipynb" and "Sunsets.py"
> 2- Name 3 classes classified data "trainval_phys_3calsses" and "trest_phys_3calsses" or change the files name in the notebook and make sure they are also in the dataset folder.


Note: Below my best hyper-parameters for the 3 class predictor:
> batch_size = 256
> optimizer = Adam
> lr = 3e-6
> epochs = 10
